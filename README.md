### What I learned

So far, I realize how much I have improved using HTML and CSS, as well as sharpening my senses to look for errors and possible improvements in the code.
Here are some lines of code to exemplify my current knowledge:

```html
<h1 class="titleEx">Well, this is obviously a Title!</h1>
<p class="paragraphEx">
  This is a really short paragraph! I can't really think anything else to write
  here so...
  <a href="https://github.com/andre-almeida-2121"
    >how about taking a look on my github</a
  >
  or
  <a href="https://www.frontendmentor.io/profile/andre-almeida-2121"
    >my profile on Frontend Mentor?!</a
  >
</p>
```

```css
.titleEx {
  font-family: "Figtree", sans-serif;
  font-size: 1.5rem;
  color: hsl(0, 0%, 7%);
  margin-bottom: 0.5rem;
}

.paragraphEx {
  font-family: "Figtree", sans-serif;
  font-size: 1rem;
  line-height: 1.6;
  color: hsl(0, 0%, 42%);
  max-width: 600px;
}

/*URLs, if you didn't notice*/
.paragraphEx a {
  color: hsl(228, 45%, 44%);
  text-decoration: none;
  font-weight: 600;
}

.paragraphEx a:hover,
.paragraphEx a:focus {
  color: hsl(47, 88%, 63%);
  outline: none;
  text-decoration: underline;
}
```

### Continued development

As I said in the last challenge... I intend to continue improving myself, to show how far I can go in Frontend!
